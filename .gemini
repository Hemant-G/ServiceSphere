## Rules

- Use `const` for variables that are not reassigned.
- Use `let` only for variables that need to be reassigned.
- Use strict equality (`===`) and inequality (`!==`) operators.
- Keep lines of code under 100 characters for better readability.
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- For React, use functional components with Hooks over class components.
- All API routes in the backend should be versioned (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).
